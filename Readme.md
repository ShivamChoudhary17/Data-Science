# Linear Regression :-

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is both a statistical algorithm and a machine learning algorithm.

When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as *simple linear regression*. When there are multiple input variables, literature from statistics often refers to the method as *multiple linear regression*.

**Simple linear regression** :
1 dependent variable (interval or ratio), 1 independent variable (interval or ratio or dichotomous).

**Multiple linear regression** :
1 dependent variable (interval or ratio) , 2+ independent variables (interval or ratio or dichotomous).

**Logistic regression** :
1 dependent variable (dichotomous), 2+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous).

**Note-** Ordinary Least Squares and Gradient Descent are two common. 

- Four techniques to prepare a linear regression mode :-
1. Simple Linear Regression
  > With simple linear regression when we have a single input, we can use statistics to estimate the coefficients.
  > This requires that you calculate statistical properties from the data such as means, standard deviations, correlations and covariance. All of the data must be available to       > traverse and calculate statistics.
