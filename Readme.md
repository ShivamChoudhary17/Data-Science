# Linear Regression :-

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is both a statistical algorithm and a machine learning algorithm.

When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression. When there are multiple input variables, literature from statistics often refers to the method as multiple linear regression
